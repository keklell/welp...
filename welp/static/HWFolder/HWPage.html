<h1>Welcome to WELP!</h1>
<p>In my Computer Science Internal Assessment, I've embarked on a comprehensive journey to develop a web application with a dual focus on frontend and backend development. My journey commenced by acquiring foundational knowledge in Python for backend scripting, and HTML and CSS for frontend design, laying the groundwork for a well-rounded skill set.<p>

<p>To enhance the functionality of my project, I immersed myself in understanding the Yelp Fusion API. This deep dive into the API's features and capabilities provided me with valuable insights, enabling me to harness real-time data and interactions for my web application.<p>

<p>Ensuring a seamless development environment was crucial, so I diligently installed necessary software, including Python and Visual Studio Code, onto my dedicated machine. This set the stage for an efficient coding process and a conducive workspace.<p>

<p>Organizing my project for clarity and efficiency was the next step. I created a well-structured workspace in Visual Studio Code, fostering a systematic approach to coding and facilitating effective project management and version control.<p>

<p>To optimize the backend's functionality, I established a virtual environment (venv) and installed critical libraries. Notably, numpy was included for its versatility, the Yelp Fusion API library for the foundation of my project, and Django, a local web hosting library, to streamline web development.<p>

<p>Moreover, I took a step further in establishing a distinct online presence by creating a domain name for my website. This not only adds a professional touch but also enhances the accessibility and recognition of my web application.<p>

<p>Looking ahead, my focus remains on refining both frontend and backend components, seamlessly integrating the Yelp Fusion API, and ensuring the overall success of my web application.</p>
