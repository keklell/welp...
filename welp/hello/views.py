My journey commenced by acquiring foundational knowledge in Python for backend scripting, and HTML and CSS for frontend design, laying the groundwork for a well-rounded skill set. To enhance the functionality of my project, I immersed myself in understanding the Yelp Fusion API. This deep dive into the API's features and capabilities provided me with valuable insights, enabling me to harness real-time data and interactions for my web application. Ensuring a seamless development environment was crucial, so I diligently installed necessary software, including Python and Visual Studio Code, onto my dedicated machine. This set the stage for an efficient coding process and a conducive workspace. Organizing my project for clarity and efficiency was the next step. I created a well-structured workspace in Visual Studio Code, fostering a systematic approach to coding and facilitating effective project management and version control. To optimize the backend's functionality, I established a virtual environment (venv) and installed critical libraries. Notably, numpy was included for its versatility, the Yelp Fusion API library for the foundation of my project, and Django, a local web hosting library, to streamline web development. Moreover, I took a step further in establishing a distinct online presence by creating a domain name for my website. This not only adds a professional touch but also enhances the accessibility and recognition of my web application. Looking ahead, my focus remains on refining both frontend and backend components, seamlessly integrating the Yelp Fusion API, and ensuring the overall success of my web application.")
